Crosslinked Hyperbranched Poly(aryletherketone) Membranes for Gas Separation at Elevated Temperature,"Gas separation techniques currently use energy-intensive condensation methods. While the high chemical and thermal stability of commercially available PAEKs make them promising membrane candidates, poor solubility hinders their processability and low glass transition temperatures (~150°C) limits their applicability for high temperature separations. Soluble, reactive hyperbranched poly(aryletherketone)s (HBPAEKs) have been developed that are easily processed into thin membranes that demonstrate gas separation at high temperatures over extended periods. Crosslinking of the HBPEAKs increases the glass transition temperatures (~250°C) of the resulting thin films and tunable free volume, enabling their use as gas separation membranes with performance that exceeds current state-of-the-art membranes.Advantages:· H2/CH4, H2/N2, and H2/CO2 separation at or near the Robeson limit· Continuous separation of H2/N2 at 200°C for two weeks without a decrease in selectivity or permeability·",Nouvant,https://www.nouvant.com,Theo Dingemans,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585261_theo-dingemans,John Rainwater Commercialization Manager 919.445.9371,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/365_john-rainwater,Provisional Patent Application Filed ,#19-0022
Microwave Synthesis of Polymeric Nanoparticles of Controlled Size for Drug Delivery,"The use of nanoparticles in enhanced delivery of drugs to cancerous tissue can minimize the toxicity and side effects attributed to chemotherapy. The present method, Zapped Assembly of Polymeric (ZAP) nanoparticles (NP), uses microwave irradiation of block copolymers to produce nanoparticles of controlled size in a scalable manner. Block copolymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), rapidly disperse in the solvent at elevated temperatures provided by microwave heating. Upon cooling, the polymers solidify into nanoparticles through nanoprecipitation. The resulting nanoparticles can be used to encapsulate biologically active molecules such as anti-cancer agents. This microwave-assisted synthetic platform provides the ability to rapidly develop size-specific PLGA NPs for drug delivery applications.· Nanoparticle sizes range from sub-20 nm to 350 nm in diameter· Tunable control of nanoparticle sizes based on the reaction parameters in microwave synthesis· PLGA copolymer provides a hydrophilic corona with PEG to promote prolonged circulation and evasion of the reticuloendothelial systemStage of Development: This method has been demonstrated in the laboratory. Specifically, stable PLGA5k 25 nm, PLGA10k 50 nm, and PLGA20k 100 nm NPs were synthesized at laboratory scale. The NPs were also loaded with the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel (PXL) and elicited dose-dependent cancer cell cytotoxicity.",Zapped assembly of polymeric (ZAP) nanoparticles for anti-cancer drug delivery,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/nr/c8nr09944h#!divAbstract,Matthew Parrott,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585138_matthew-parrott,John Rainwater Commercialization Manager 919.445.9371,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/365_john-rainwater,Provisional Patent Application Filed ,#17-0081
Gamma Secretase Inhibitors Attenuate Vascular Malformations,"Gamma secretase inhibitors (GSI) have been determined to attenuate vascular malformations by inhibiting NOTCH expression in endothelial cells. Vascular malformations are developmental abnormalities of venous, arterial, capillary or lymphatic vessels which have significant morbidities such as pain, infection, pulmonary emboli, bleeding and even death. There is growing interest in medical management of vascular malformations, however existing treatments often cannot result in complete lesion resolution and do not produce permanent results, indicating that there is a significant need for alternative therapies.

The UNC approach is built on advances in precomputed light transport techniques for visual rendering and uses them to develop an improved acoustic radiance transfer technique. It precomputes a direct-to-indirect acoustic transfer operator for a scene, and uses it to map direct sound incident on the surfaces of the scene to multibounce diffuse indirect sound, which is gathered at the listener to compute the final impulse response. The algorithm decouples the transfer operator from the source position so it can efficiently update the acoustic response at the listener when the source moves.Video:",http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/Sound/diffuse/2010-tvcg-video.mov,http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/Sound/diffuse/2010-tvcg-video.mov,Dinesh Manocha,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584862_dinesh-manocha,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,"US Patent 8,995,675",#11-0048
Image Analysis with Deep Learning For Molecular Subtyping of Breast Cancer,"RNA-based, multi-gene molecular assays are available and widely used for patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. However, RNA-based genomic tests can be costly and are not available in many countries. Methods for inferring molecular subtype from histologic images may identify patients most likely to benefit from further genomic testing. To identify patients who could benefit from molecular testing based on H&E-stained histologic images, we developed an image analysis approach using deep learning. Our investigators created image-based classifiers for tumor grade, ER status, PAM50 intrinsic subtype, histologic subtype, and risk of recurrence score (ROR-PT). The resulting classifiers were applied to an independent test set, and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each assessed on the test set. Histologic image analysis with deep learning distinguished low-intermediate vs. high tumor grade ER status, Basal-like vs. non-Basal-like, Ductal vs. Lobular, and high vs. low-medium ROR-PT scores with good accuracy. Image-based methods could be promising for identifying patients with a greater need for further genomic testing, or in place of classically scored variables typically accomplished using human-based scoring.","Image analysis with deep learning to predict breast cancer grade, ER status, histologic subtype, and intrinsic subtype.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30182055,Charles Perou,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585262_charles-perou,Jackie Quay Director 919.966.3929,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/370_jackie-quay,Jackie Quay Director 919.966.3929,#19-0010

Combined Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARGI) Ultrasound and Elastography for Improved Tissue Imaging,"Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) ultrasound is a tissue imaging method where a short duration impulse (on the order of microseconds) of relatively high acoustic energy is transmitted into the body. The tissue’s response in terms of its peak displacement and subsequent recovery from displacement is used as an indicator of the tissue’s mechanical properties. The use of ARFI for elastography yields enhanced differentiation of tissue mechanical property. This technique allows for targeted regions of excitation, resulting in increased spatial resolution of mechanical property analysis. Combined ARFI-Elastography would be useful in breast, vascular, cardiac, abdominal, and other ultrasonic imaging applications.

Novel Cross-Linker and Related Methods of Isotope Tagging for Analysis of Protein Interactions,"An isotope labeled cross-linker has been developed to improve the detection of cross-linked peptides. Chemical cross-linking is often used to study protein-protein interactions, however gas-phase dissociation reactions of cross-linkers often lack the sensitivity and specificity to fragment the cross-linker at the desired location. Consequently, there is a need for improved cross-linkers for studying protein interactions. The developed cross-linker (d4-DTSSP) is asymmetric across a single cleavable bond (versus symmetrical like other commercially available DTSSP), and allows for a unique detection strategy that can differentiate cross-linked fragments from non cross-linked fragment ions that can easily be visually differentiated using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, d4-DTSSP uses a simple electron transfer (EDT) dissociation reaction that allows for high efficiency and product yield along with the identification of interacting proteins. d4-DTSSP has the potential to significantly enhance the utility of chemical cross-linking for the study of protein-protein interactions.Advantages:· Allows for a unique detection strategy that identifies cross-linked from non-cross-linked fragments· May improve throughput in identifying cross-linked fragments by allowing automated peak-picking·",Nouvant,https://www.nouvant.com,Xian Chen,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584903_xian-chen,"Kelly Parsons Associate Director, Technology Commercialization 919.962.6277",http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/371_kelly-parsons,US Patent US 9562010,#13-0034

Higher Frame Rate Ultrasound Imaging for Improved Detection of Human Physiological Events,"Ultrasound imaging at high frame rates (50 Hz or greater) is reliant on plane-wave transmission. Unfortunately, high frame rate imaging is not conducive with compounding, or averaging, of different acoustic signals to improve image quality. With every ultrasound transmit being devoted to image quality, that is one transmission being lost for analysis of temporal changes in the image. As the field of ultrasound progresses with techniques reliant on faster imaging, such as super resolution, it is not only beneficial to image fast, but also to maintain sensitivity. Adaptive multifocus beamforming is a technique that utilizes a unique transmission to focus the beam in multiple locations in the field of view, while mainting the desired high-frame rate. In this manner, high-frame rate ultrasound images possses a signal-to-noise ratio not achievable previously. Not only could this improve signal tracking in even the slowest of capillaries, deeper penetration depths may be reached, providing more information for physiological assessment.Advantages:

This unique use of ARFI to measure anisotropy has significant advantages in the clinical space. UNC researchers have developed the disclosed technology is capable of quantifying peak displacements in orthogonal dimensions. With this information, the degree of anisotropy of the tissue can be monitored during disease progression, increasing the information one can gather from ultrasound systems. Developments in ultrasound imaging have led to a $7.3 billion USD industry.

Detection of Brain Motion with High-frame Rate Ultrasound Imaging,"There is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms at work during a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Though brain motion has been extensively linked to TBI, direct quantifiable measurements are absent, which could aid in progressing understanding and diagnosis of TBI. The Pinton lab has developed an ultrasonic method for detecting the motion of the brain, at frame rates as high as 10,000 images per second. With a novel motion tracking algorithm, the imaging technique can quantify movement of the brain with displacements down to 1 micron. Through the advancement and implementation of this technique, it is anticipated that the detection of brain motion will further the understanding of the mechanism of trauma.

<!–[endif]–>At 10,000 images per sec, superior motion detection can be achieved, at a spatial sensitivity better than 1 micron.

Combined Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARGI) Ultrasound and Elastography  for Tissue Imaging,"Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) ultrasound is a tissue imaging method where a short duration impulse (on the order of microseconds) of relatively high acoustic energy is transmitted into the body. The tissue’s response in terms of its peak displacement and subsequent recovery from displacement is used as an indicator of the tissue’s mechanical properties. The use of ARFI for elastography yields enhanced differentiation of tissue mechanical property. This technique allows for targeted regions of excitation, resulting in increased spatial resolution of mechanical property analysis. Combined ARFI-Elastography would be useful in breast, vascular, cardiac, abdominal, and other ultrasonic imaging applications. Similar principles may be applied to other medical imaging modalities, such as MRI and Optical imaging. Developments in ultrasound imaging, such as ARFI for elastography, will have helped lead the market to a $7 billion USD industry by 2024.<!–[if !supportLists]–>• <!–[endif]–>Ability to palpate tissue further than human reach<!–[if !supportLists]–>•",Nouvant,https://www.nouvant.com,Caterina Gallippi,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584832_caterina-gallippi,Charlie Shaw Commercialization Manager 919.966.3929,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/373_charlie-shaw,"US Patent 9,043,156",#08-0050

Hinged endoscopic catheter for easier treatment of intestinal obstruction,"Intestinal obstruction can result from a variety of medical problems, including gastric outlet obstruction, chronic ulcers, and cancer of the stomach or pancreas, and it leads to impaired or blocked digestion of food, numerous gastrointestinal symptoms, and malnutrition. A common solution to these cases is to bypass the obstruction by creating a connection between the stomach and the small intestine through a procedure called a gastrojejunostomy, allowing the contents of the stomach to continue through the digestive tract unimpeded. Researchers at UNC have developed a custom catheter for improving the safety and speed of this commonly performed surgery. The catheter can be manipulated to bring the small intestine closer to the stomach, facilitating easier placement of the connecting tube. It also expands to open the lumen of the small intestine, minimizing the risk of accidental puncture all the way through.Advantages:· Facilitates accurate procedures by pushing the small intestine against the stomach· Minimizes the risk of unintended intestinal punctures by opening up the small intestine before needle insertion·",Nouvant,https://www.nouvant.com,Theodore James,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585239_theodore-james,Charlie Shaw Commercialization Manager 919.966.3929,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/373_charlie-shaw,Charlie Shaw Commercialization Manager 919.966.3929,#18-0015

Nanoparticles for the Codelivery of Cancer Immunotherapeutics,"Dual immunotherapy nanoparticles (DINPs) that can simultaneously deliver multiple immunotherapeutics have been synthesized. Emerging evidence suggests that administration of certain immunotherapeutics in combination has a synergistic effect. Specifically, an approach that can block checkpoint inhibitor receptors, like PD1, while activating co-stimulatory receptors, like OX40, is desired. This can be done by utilizing our dual immunotherapy nanoparticles (DINPs). Using DINPs enabled simultaneous delivery of anti-PD1 and anti-OX40 antibodies (Abs) to T cells. Data indicates that codelivery of these Abs by DINPs induced a higher immunotherapeutic response than administration of the free Abs in vivo.

"Neurosteroid-induced protection against alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and other neuropsychiatric disorders","Several naturally-occurring neurosteroids have shown protection against alcohol use disorder, depression, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and other neuropsychiatric disorders in animal models. These disorders affect a large portion of the population, with 6.2% of adults in the United States suffering from alcohol use disorder alone. Protective action of these neurosteroids has been observed, but the mechanism for these benefits has not been shown. Development of these neurosteroids as therapeutics in humans, as well as efforts to find more neurosteroids with protective action, depend on a more complete understanding of how they protect against depression and other disorders.

A General and Efficient Self-Assembly System for the Generation of Thermostable Heptameric Targeting Ligands with Significantly Improved Target-Binding Strength,"A simple and efficient method for the self-assembly of heptameric targeting ligands has been developed. Many developing therapies and diagnostics rely on the use of targeting ligands, such as homing peptides, protein-binding domains, and antibodies. Often, improving the targeting ligand’s affinity for its target is a time-consuming process, requiring extensive affinity maturation. Our technology allows for an alternative strategy: the creation of multiple binding interactions with the target via a multimeric targeting ligand. In addition to enhanced binding affinity, these multivalent targeting ligands offer improved biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties when compared to conventional monovalent ligands. Data indicate that these heptamers exhibit 100-1000x greater target-binding strength than their monomeric counterparts. This technology was used to synthesize heptameric antibodies, targeting the EGFR and HER2 receptors, that possessed high stability, enhanced avidity, and low toxicity.Advantages:-Allows for the self-assembly of heptameric target ligands-Heptameric target ligands show 100-1000x greater binding-strength than monomer target ligands-Multivalent target ligands possess improved biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties.",Heptameric Targeting Ligands against EGFR and HER2 with High Stability and Avidity,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043077,Rihe Liu,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584860_rihe-liu,Leodis Gupton Commercialization Manager 919.966.4132,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/369_leodis-gupton,US Patent US 9340616,#11-0065

Aerosolized Formulation of Pyrazinoic Acid for the Treatment of Tuberculosis,"Pyrazinamide (PZA) can shorten the treatment time of tuberculosis (TB) by six months and is the only drug deemed irreplaceable in the standard TB treatment regimen, yet approximately fifty percent of multiple drug resistant TB are resistant to PZA. It is believed that the use of the active form of PZA, pyrazinoic acid (POA), instead of PZA to treat TB could circumvent the problem of resistance. However, POA is not effective when administered orally. We have developed novel aerosolized formulations of POA and pyrazinoic acid esters (PAEs) that, when administered in a guinea pig model, significantly decrease the bacterial burden of the lungs. In addition, the above treatment was able to induce host-directed effects against TB, leading to a reduction of bacterial burden in the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. The use of aerosolized POA/PAEs versus oral PZA circumvents problems with bioavailability and allows for a lower effective dose, thereby decreasing toxicity. This aerosolized POA represents a novel approach to the treatment of TB.Advantages:-Aerosolized formulation avoids problems associated with oral bioavailability and toxicity- Requires lower dosage than conventional treatment with PZA-In addition to the therapeutic effect in the lung, treatment has a systemic effect that increases clearance of TB in the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes",Inhaled Pyrazinoic Acid Esters for the Treatment of Tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27351427,Miriam Braunstein,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585147_miriam-braunstein,Kyle Bartholomew  ,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/447_kyle-bartholomew,PCT Patent Application WO 2018/090004,#17-0068
CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Therapy for Angelman Syndrome,"A potential cure for Angelman syndrome (AS) has been developed utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. AS is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1 in 15,000 people, causing severe intellectual disabilities, seizures, and mutism. AS is caused by a deletion or mutation in the maternal copy of the UBE3A allele. While individuals inherit one copy of UBE3A from their mother and another from their father, the paternal allele is naturally silenced. Gene therapy approaches are being developed which deliver a normal copy of UBE3A. However, this will likely be problematic since overexpression of UBE3A can lead to autism. We have discovered a means to alter the antisense transcript that is responsible for silencing the paternal copy of UBE3A using CRISPR/Cas9. This modification eliminates the transcript’s ability to bind with the paternal allele, thereby allowing for expression of functional UBE3A at normal levels from the paternal allele.",Nouvant,https://www.nouvant.com,Mark Zylka,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585201_mark-zylka,"Kelly Parsons Associate Director, Technology Commercialization 919.962.6277",http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/371_kelly-parsons,Provisional Patent Application Filed ,#18-0085

Improved Image and Video Decompression,"A technique for image and video decompression has been developed that respects intensity and spatial uncertainty in the encoded stream to significantly improve the perceived quality of final image or video output. This technique avoids spatial and intensity thresholding artifacts by adding noise and spatial blurring into the data stream during the decompression process; these decrease “banding” and “blocking” artifacts that commonly occur upon image reconstruction and detract from overall image quality. The method runs at full video rate on a commodity GPU and is particularly well suited for improving the user experience on high resolution cell phones, televisions, and computers where users commonly stream highly-compressed images or videos that are not well matched to the screen resolution of their device.Advantages:
Significantly improves image or video output quality of compressed data

Physics-Inspired Garment Recovery from a Single-View Image,"Most recent garment capturing techniques rely on acquiring multiple views of clothing, which may not always be readily available, especially in the case of pre-existing photographs from the web. This technology provides a method that is able to compute a rich and realistic 3D model of a human body and its outfits from a single photograph with little human interaction. The algorithm is not only able to capture the global shape and geometry of the clothing, it can also extract small but important details of cloth, such as occluded wrinkles and folds. Unlike previous methods using full 3D information (i.e. depth, multi-view images, or sampled 3D geometry), this approach achieves detailed garment recovery from a single-view image by using statistical, geometric, and physical priors and a combination of parameter estimation, semantic parsing, shape recovery, and physics- based cloth simulation. The technology has applications in virtual try-on and garment transfer applications, as well as cloth animation for digital characters.Video: http://www.cs.unc.edu/~alexyang/videos/iccvdemo.mp4",http://www.cs.unc.edu/~alexyang/videos/iccv,http://www.cs.unc.edu/~alexyang/videos/iccv,Shan Yang,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585011_shan-yang,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,US Patent Pending US-2019-0043269,#16-0167

High-Order Diffraction and Diffuse Reflections For Interactive Sound Propagation in Large Environments,"Virtual environments such as cities, auditoriums, offices, and factories can span extremely large areas and may be composed of many moving sources and objects. Accurate sound propagation in these environments requires modeling complex acoustic effects such as reflections, scattering between objects, high-order diffractions, late reverberation, echoes, etc. New algorithms to enable interactive geometric sound propagation in complex scenes have been developed that can generate plausible sound effects at interactive rates in large, dynamic scenes that have multiple sound sources. A novel algorithm to compute diffuse reflections and higher order diffraction based on ray-based sound propagation is used that is directly applicable to complex geometric datasets. Furthermore, algorithms for wavelength-dependent simplification and visibility graph computation to accelerate higher-order diffraction at runtime are also described. Together these technologies result in an order-of-magnitude performance increase over prior methods with comparable accuracy.",High-order diffraction and diffuse reflections for interactive sound propagation in large environments,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2601216,Carl Schissler,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584912_carl-schissler,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,US Patent Pending US 2015/0378019,#14-0094
Sound Propagation in Large Complex Environments Using Wave-Ray Coupling,"Accurate sound propagation has become fundamental to many interactive (i.e. gaming and virtual reality) and offline (i.e. noise prediction in urban scenes, architectural acoustics, and prototyping) applications. Many wave-based techniques for sound propagation are spatially limited and limited to low frequency applications due to computational complexity. On the other hand, geometric techniques for sound propagation are unable to simulate many acoustic effects (i.e. diffraction, interference, and higher-order wave effects) at low frequencies. A new hybrid technique for interactive sound propagation in large, complex indoor and outdoor scenes has been developed that combines the strengths of numerical and geometric acoustic techniques for the different parts of the domain. The more accurate and costly numerical technique is used to model wave phenomena in near-object regions, while the more efficient geometric technique is used to handle propagation in far-field regions and interaction with the environment. The sound pressure field generated by the two techniques is coupled using a novel two-way coupling procedure. The new technique can simulate realistic, high-fidelity acoustic effects using orders of magnitude lower memory than standard wave-based numerical techniques.",Wave-ray coupling for interactive sound propagation in large complex scenes,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2508420,Hengchin Yeh,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584891_hengchin-yeh,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,US Patent Pending US 2015/0294041,#13-0089

The geometry of the light sources, spatial light modulator, and viewer are arranged so that each pixel on the spatial light modulator is illuminated by a single light source, allowing a clear image to be formed on the eye. The spatial light modulator and backlight are transparent or nearly-transparent, allowing the user’s environment to be seen through the display.

Sound Propagation in Large Scenes using Equivalent Sources,"Interactive, wave-based sound propagation that captures important acoustic phenomena (i.e. interference, diffraction, scattering, sound focusing, and high-order wave effects) for large, open virtual environments or scenes found in simulation and training systems or in video games can take hours of computation and gigabytes of memory even while using state-of-the-art wave simulation methods. A new object-centric algorithm for wave-based sound propagation that captures acoustic effects such as high-order diffraction and scattering using an equivalent source formulation has been developed. During preprocessing, the method uses object-based sound field decomposition to segment a scene into well-separated, rigid objects. The acoustic behavior of the objects and inter-object interactions is expressed by matrix-based transfer functions using an equivalent source formulation that can then be used to compute the acoustic response of the scene to a static source distribution. At runtime, summation of outgoing equivalent sources for all objects is performed at the listener location for real-time sound rendering for a moving listener. Scenes with moving sources and a static listener can be handled by exploiting acoustic reciprocity. The technique can perform accurate sound propagation on large, open scenes in real-time, has a small memory footprint, and allows flexible efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs.",Wave-based sound propagation in large open scenes using an equivalent source formulation,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2451245,Ravish Mehra,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584881_ravish-mehra,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,"US Patent 9,711,126",#12-0052

Fast Geometric Sound Propagation using Visibility Computations,"In order to create immersive, multimodal virtual reality for use in interactive applications, geometric acoustic algorithms that can quickly and efficiently compute sound propagation paths for complex 3D models and virtual environments at high frame rates on commodity hardware are needed. A new method for simulation of sound propagation has been developed that harnesses geometric acoustics and conservative visibility techniques to quickly and accurately compute sound propagation paths of complex scenes. From a defined sound source position in a given scene, a complex visibility tree can be constructed. This method uses conservative (e.g. occlusion culling) from-region visibility techniques to model sound diffraction and conservative from-point visibility techniques to model specular sound reflections to significantly reduce the complexity of the visibility tree. The new simplified tree can then be used to generate an impulse response for the scene and in turn quickly and accurately simulate sound propagation in the scene.Advantages:Faster and more efficient than approaches using exact from-point visibility algorithms",Fast and Accurate Geometric Sound Propagation Using Visibility Computations,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1260/1351-010X.18.1-2.123,Dinesh Manocha,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584863_dinesh-manocha,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,"US Patent 8,847,965",#11-0047

Ceria Nanoparticles for the Treatment of Macular Degeneration and Retinoblastoma,"A novel formulation of ceria nanoparticles (nanoceria) has been developed for the treatment of oxidative stress-related disorders. Nanoceria possess unique antioxidant properties at physiological pH that make them candidates for the treatment of oxidative stress-related disorders and have intrinsic oxidase activity at acidic pH which make nanoceria a potential anti-tumor agent within the tumor microenvironment. However, the poor solubility of nanoceria have historically limited their pharmacological application. We have developed a formulation of nanoceria, using a chitosan derivative, which renders them water soluble and allows for their synthesis in an aqueous environment. The formulation also provides a scaffold for surface engineering to allow for targeted delivery and the attachment of therapeutics, such as anti-cancer agents, for combination therapy. We have demonstrated that these nanoceria have therapeutic efficacy in a murine model of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and formulations in hydrogel provide sustained release for 2+ months in the eye. Additionally, our studies indicate that these nanoparticles have a synergistic anti-tumor effect when administered in combination with a chemotherapy agent and tumor-targeting ligand in both a genetic retinoblastoma mouse model and a xenograft retinoblastoma mouse model.",Glycol Chitosan Engineered Autoregenerative Antioxidant Significantly Attenuates Pathological Damages in Models of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28463509,Zongchao Han,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585036_zongchao-han,"Kelly Parsons Associate Director, Technology Commercialization 919.962.6277",http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/371_kelly-parsons,PCT Patent Application WO 2018/152283,#16-0108
Quercetin Prodrug Nanoparticle for Modifying Tumor Microenvironment,"Quercetin is a naturally occuring flavonoid commonly found in fruits and vegtables. It has been shown to regulate many biological pathways that lead to apoptosis, angiogenesis inhibition and cellular proliferation. Quercetin has been examined in several clinical trials as an anti-cancer, anti-tumor agent decades ago however due to poor water solubility and bioavailability has limited its use or approval as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic. Significant research efforts have been committed to overcome the poor physiochemical properties of quercetin without much success. Therefore, alternative strategies are needed to improve the solubility and bioavailability of this potential therapeutic.Recently, a novel solution to address the physiochemical properties associated with quercetin has been developed. Briefly, UNC researchers led by Dr. Leaf Huang has developed a lipid calcium phosphate quercetin prodrug (LCP-QP) nanoparticle formulation which overcomes the aforementioned challenges. LCP-QP nanoparticle formulation is able to obtain high drug loading capacities while maintaining a small particle size, increased stability, and bioavailability. Moreover, the LCP-QP formulation results in increased tumor accumulation, cellular uptake, and intracellular release of the quercetin prodrug. LCP-QP also deploys a tumor-specific targeting molecule to enhance its delivery of the therapeutic payload. Recent preliminary studies have illustrated significantly enhanced antitumor efficiency while mainitaining a favorable toxicity safety profile.","Quercetin Remodels the Tumor Microenvironment To Improve the Permeation, Retention, and Antitumor Effects of Nanoparticles",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.7b01522,Leaf Huang,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585024_leaf-huang,Leodis Gupton Commercialization Manager 919.966.4132,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/369_leodis-gupton,Cancer Nanotechnology Research Award,#16-0156

Inhibition of Type I Interferon Signaling to Enhance T Cell Recovery and Reduce HIV-1 Reservoirs During Combined Antiretroviral Therapy,"Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) efficiently suppresses HIV-1 replication and enhances the number of immune cells in infected individuals. However, it does not rescue their immune hyperactivation and dysfunction. We have demonstrated that treatment of HIV-1 persistently infected humanized mice with an anti-IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) antibody in the presence of cART fully reversed HIV-1-induced immune hyeractivation and restored anti-HIV-1 immune responses in T cells from such HIV-1 infected humanized mice. In addition, treatment of the humanized mice with the anti-IFNAR antibody reduced the size of HIV-1 reservoirs in lymphoid tissues during cART. Data suggests that this approach could enhance the management of HIV-1 infection since mice treated with the anti-IFNAR antibody demonstrate an enhanced delay of the return of HIV-1 titers after the cessation of cART therapy.",Blocking type I interferon signaling enhances T cell recovery and reduces HIV-1 reservoirs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941247,Lishan Su,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585026_lishan-su,Kyle Bartholomew  ,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/447_kyle-bartholomew,PCT Patent Application WO2018/081197,#16-0154
Heterochromatin Gene Repression Inhibitors as Novel Epigenetic Cancer Therapeutics,"Heterochromatin gene repression is a major mammalian regulatory pathway that recently was found dysregulated in multiple human cancers including those of the liver and breast. Research in the Hathaway lab has identified a series of cell-permeable, potent, and specific inhibitors of the HP1-mediated heterochromatin gene repression pathway. Our four lead compounds represent a new class of epigenetic inhibitors capable of inhibiting global heterochromatin gene repression as measured by the signature heterochromatin mark H3K9me3.Potential Applications:Genomic studies have revealed that chromatin-based mechanisms are driver mutations in an expansive set of human malignant diseases and underlie the pathology of many cancers. The precise role of heterochromatin in cancer is complicated and still not entirely clear, this is partially due to the lack of even poor chemical inhibitors of the HP1 pathway. HP1 is overexpressed in human cancers of the breast, prostate, and pancreas. High levels of H3K9me3 (the signature mark of heterochromatin) strongly correlate with mutation rates in human cancers 9. Elevated HP1 levels correlate with decreased survival of patients with breast (HP1a) and prostate cancer (HP1?).

Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) Compounds,"Sleeping sickness or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is endemic in 37 African countries and around 13 million people are at medium to high risk of being infected. Sleeping sickness is transmitted by the tsetse fly and is usually fatal without treatment. It occurs in two stages; the early stage (stage 1) with non-specific symptoms, often un- or misdiagnosed - the late stage (stage 2) where the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier, causing serious neurological disorders including sleep cycle disruptions, neurological manifestations, and progressive mental deterioration.Until 2009, treatments for stage 2 of the disease were toxic or difficult to administer. Conventional combination therapy Nifurtimox-Eflornithine (NECT), replaced the toxic arsenic-based treatments for HAT. Although effective in treating stage 2 HAT, NECT has led to a decrease in the disease incidence. The need for new anti-HAT drugs persists, as current drugs are few, antiquated, toxic, prone to resistance, and require parenteral administration.Research at UNC and collaborators have developed a novel class of oral compounds capable of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) with enhanced properties to combat this highly neglected disease. This work describes the synthesis of analogues that may be effective for the treatment of early and late stage HAT, Chagas disease, and potentially Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT).",Urea Derivatives of 2-Aryl-benzothiazol-5-amines: A New Class of Potential Drugs for Human African Trypanosomiasis.,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01163,Richard Tidwell,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585044_richard-tidwell,Leodis Gupton Commercialization Manager 919.966.4132,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/369_leodis-gupton,PCT Patent Application PCT/US2017/014256,#16-0082

Bi-functional Chemical Epigenetic Modifiers (CEM)s,"Epigenome editing is a powerful method for life science research and offers great potential for the development of therapeutics for human diseases such as cancers and autoimmune disorders.The underlying mechanisms by which histone-modifying proteins work in concert to properly regulate gene expression still remain largely unkown. UNC inventors have developed a small-molecule platform for specifically inducing gene repression and histone deacetylation at a reporter gene to investigate and manipulate complex epigenetic interactions in live cells.Chromatin Epigenetic Modifers (CEMs) technology can intricately control gene expression of any mammalian gene. The technology platform utilizes a new bifunctional small molecules to bind endogenous gene regulatory enzymes and recruit these enzymes to the desired gene using deactivated dCAS9 gene targeting.These novel compounds have been deployed in a dose-dependent and reversible fashion to repress gene expression in a murine stem cell model system. Our fresh approach details a new method of synthetically controlling gene expression programs using the cell’s own machinery and has broad applications in drug discovery research. The advantage of our technique over other currently developed strategies is the use of the bifunctional CEM to control activity.Potential Applications:Cancer therapeutics: Our CEM technique can be used to repress key oncogenes driving cancer. Alternatively, it can be used to activate tumor suppressor genes that have been epigenetically silenced in cancer. We are currently testing both approaches in colon and prostate cancer models.Discovery research: This chemical technology is modular and can be used to study a variety of chromatin regulation pathways, by making CEMs that engage other chromatin enzymes.",Targeted Gene Repression Using Novel Bifunctional Molecules to Harness Endogenous Histone Deacetylation Activity,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00295,Nate Hathaway,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585100_nate-hathaway,Leodis Gupton Commercialization Manager 919.966.4132,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/369_leodis-gupton,Provisional Patent Application Filed ,#17-0151

Enhancing Purity and Safety of AAV Vector Preparations for Gene Therapy,"A novel method has been developed to resolve the mass landscape of whole viral particles, capsid intermediates, and viral genomes present in adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector preparations based on charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS).CDMS not only provides an accurate analysis of diversity within AAV vector preparations, but it can dramatically shorten the analysis time. CDMS can also enhance current quality control protocols for AAV vector analysis, help identify potential contaminants, and also shed light on AAV capsid dynamics during the infectious pathway. This method will have a significant impact on clinical AAV vector preparations which often contain variable levels of full or partial-genome containing particles and emptyvectors. Consequently,the composition of these preparationscan influence vector dose-related immunotoxicity in patients.This novel method has the potential to greatly increase the efficiency, purity, and safety of AAV therapy.Features and Advantages· Novel method that analyzes the entire landscape of AAV vector preparations· Can establish the mass and stoichiometry of AAV capsids complexed with exogenous proteins, nucleic acids, or carbohydrates· Determines the purity of recombinant AAV preparations for clinical applications· Shortens the analysis time from hours to minutes, and can be seamlessly integrated into current quality control protocols",Resolving Adeno-Associated Viral Particle Diversity With Charge Detection Mass Spectrometry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27310298,Aravind Asokan,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584955_aravind-asokan,"Kelly Parsons Associate Director, Technology Commercialization 919.962.6277",http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/371_kelly-parsons,Provisional Patent Application Filed ,#15-0118

Chimeric VLP for Vaccination Against G11.4 Norovirus Strains,"A virus-like particle (VLP) has been developed in order to induce a more broadly blocking immune response against G11.4 strains of norovirus. This VLP contains multiple epitopes of different strains of norovirus in a backbone of a single strain, and consequently induces a more broadly blocking immune response than single strains alone. G11.4 noroviruses account for the majority of all norovirus outbreaks, however no approved vaccine against this strain of norovirus exists due to the antigenic variation of G11.4 variations.

Antibody Therapeutic for the Treatment of Lupus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) is a complex autoimmune disease with underlying genetic and environmental etiologies. Multiple single genes, molecular events, and cell types have been implicated in disease; however, recent therapies targeting single gene products (B-cell Activating Factor, BAFF) or single cells (B cells) have shown marginal therapeutic success. To improve efficacy, we developed a strategy to target immune dysregulation upstream of multiple SLE-associated pathologies. This strategy is based on our findings that lysosomes in lupus-prone mice fail to acidify and degrade immune complexes (IgG autoantibody bound to dead cell debris; IgG-immune complexes). In addition, we show that undegraded IgG-immune complexes promote chronic binding of IgG-immune complexes to particular receptors leading to BAFF and IFNa secretion, B cell activation and autoantibody production, and cell migration and renal disease. To restore lysosome acidification and facilitate the degradation of IgG-immune complexes that are pathognomonic of lupus, we attenuate the lysosome defect and restore degradation of IgG-immune complexes by crosslinking two key surface receptors. Using a PEG-based molecule where intact antibodies binding each receptor were conjugated at differing ratios, we show that crosslinking these receptors restores lysosome acidification, clears the plasma membrane of recycled receptors, and diminishes signal transduction from the target receptors. Future work will focus on designing multivalent, bispecific antibodies to these targets.",mTORC2 Activity Disrupts Lysosome Acidification in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus by Impairing Caspase-1 Cleavage of Rab39a,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29866702,Barbara Vilen,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585165_barbara-vilen,"Kelly Parsons Associate Director, Technology Commercialization 919.962.6277",http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/371_kelly-parsons,PCT Patent Application WO 2018/064603,#17-0011
Diagnostic for ANCA-Associated Vasculitis Relapse,"ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is an autoimmune disease primarily caused by neutrophil granule proteins encoded by the genes MPO and PRTN3. AAV is characterized by vascular inflammation, and patients cycle between disease remissions interrupted by relapses of active disease. Consequently, many patients are treated with maintenance immunosuppressive drugs that can have cumulative toxic effects including infertility and malignancies after long-term exposure. Therefore, insight about disease prognosis is vital to patient care, and important to determine whether a patient needs maintenance immunosuppressive treatments. Unfortunately the amount of circulating autoantibodies is not an adequate marker of remission or disease state, and there is no reliable biomarker to indicate a state of remission.

Research at UNC has identified that a majority of the strongly neutralizing antibodies produced during dengue infection are targeted to the quaternary structure of the envelope E protein. However, since recombinant proteins are secreted as monomers, the key quaternary epitopes targeted by human antibodies are not displayed on recombinant proteins limiting effective vaccine design.

"Use of Tardigrade Proteins to Stabilize Biological Materials, Industrial Enzymes, and Agricultural Products","The instability of many high value industrial enzymes and life saving biologics, including vaccines and protein-based pharmaceuticals, require that such materials be produced, transported and stored under refrigerated conditions, which adds difficulty and expense. Lyophilization is an alternate storage method that allows some pharmaceuticals to be stored at room temperature. Unfortunately, many proteins denature and lose activity in the lyophilization process. Additionally, agents currently used to prevent desiccation-induced inactivation do not work for all products.By studying the ability of tardigrade organisms to withstand desiccation, a group of proteins has been identified that maintain the structural and functional integrity of proteins in both hydrated and dry states. Methods to purify these Tardigrade Disordered Proteins (TDPs) have been developed, and studies show that TDPs preserve the functional integrity of proteins exposed to desiccation, which enables the lyophilization process. TDPs can also be utilized at high concentrations without aggregation. This technology has the potential to improve and simplify the production and storage of numerous products, including vaccines, industrial enzymes and seeds.Advantages:· TDPs stabilize proteins in both hydrated and dry states· TDPs protect the functionality of lyophilized proteins· Could reduce or eliminate the need to refrigerate sensitive biological materials and enzymes· Could be used to increase the drought tolerance of crops",Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28306513,Gary Pielak,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585022_gary-pielak,"Kelly Parsons Associate Director, Technology Commercialization 919.962.6277",http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/371_kelly-parsons,PCT Patent Application WO 2018034867,#16-0158

This novel approach permits the silencing of multiple oncogenic KRAS forms while sparing wild-type expression.Advantages:• Targets a large percentage of human cancers• Selectively targets tumor cells while sparing normal cells• Effective against an “undruggable” target•",Therapeutic Silencing of KRAS Using Systemically Delivered siRNAs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281617,Chad Pecot,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585080_chad-pecot,Charlie Shaw Commercialization Manager 919.966.3929,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/373_charlie-shaw,PCT Patent Application WO 2017/127473,#16-0006

Dynamic Decoding for Multiplexing Bead-Based Assays,"A methodology has been developed that employs dye stability to distinguish bead populations in bead-based assay systems. This increases multiplexing capabilities beyond current limitations seen with dyes of fixed excitation/emisson wavelengths. Different dyes with similar spectral properties, but different stabilities, adds a dynamic, time-based element that can resolve different bead populations. Related technologies have been developed that increase assay performance and multiplexing capability by utilizing non-cylindrical bead well geometries to improve assay performance and readout (15-0131) and bead-based delivery of reagents to facilitate parallel assays on a multiplexed-in-space microfluidic device (12-0128).Advantages:• Employs the measurement of dye decay to provide additional encoding levels beyond static, single point measurement for distinguishing bead populations• Can be used for highly sensitive real-time PCR detection of multiple target sequences on a single chip with or without the use of sequence-specific probes•",An automated integrated platform for rapid and sensitive multiplexed protein profiling using human saliva samples,http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/lc/c3lc51303c,J Ramsey,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585076_j-ramsey,John Rainwater Commercialization Manager 919.445.9371,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/365_john-rainwater,Provisional Patent Application Filed ,#16-0015

Accurate Segmentation of Male Pelvic Organs from CT images via Regression-Based Deformable Models and Iterative Structural Refinement,"This novel method automatically segments male pelvic organs from CT images with robustness to initialization that achieves better results than current deformable models, and could greatly enhance the accuracy of pelvic segmentation consequently preventing more accurate radiotherapy treatments to patients. Segmenting pelvic organs is a prerequisite for prostate cancer radiotherapy, as the efficacy of radiation treatment heavily depends on the segmentation accuracy. However, due to low tissue contrast of CT images, and large shape and appearance variation of pelvic organs, accurate segmentation is challenging. Deformable models aim to alleviate some of these hindrances, but their success greatly depends upon initialization – especially for segmenting organs with large shape variations. This technology is a novel way to guide deformable segmentation, which makes deformable models more robust against arbitrary initializations. By learning an image regressor that predicts the 3D displacement from any image voxel to the target organ boundary, this method overcomes the initialization problem suffered by traditional deformable models. This method has been tested using images from over 300 prostate cancer patients.Advantages:• Accurate, automatic method for segmenting male pelvic organs from CT images• Makes deformable models more robust against arbitrary initialization• Unlike conventional deformable models, the deformation direction is adaptively determined for optimally driving the shape model onto the target organ•",Nouvant,https://www.nouvant.com,Dinggang Shen,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585074_dinggang-shen,Charlie Shaw Commercialization Manager 919.966.3929,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/373_charlie-shaw,PCT Patent Application WO 2017/062453,#16-0019

No-Execute-After-Read: Preventing Code Disclosure in Commodity Software,"A novel memory permission primitive, dubbed No-Execute-After-Read (NEAR), has been developed that thwarts just-in-time code reuse attacks by adversaries taking advantage of memory disclosures. Unlike Execute-no-Read, which fails to prevent such attacks, NEAR provides strong security guarantees against just-in-time attacks in commodity binaries. Specifically, NEAR allows the disclosure of all code, but prevents any disclosed code from subsequently being executed, thus fundamentally thwarting just-in-time code reuse. At the same time, commodity binaries with mixed code and data regions still operate correctly, as legitimate data is still readable. The prototype is practical and portable to various platforms and applications, and it has a negligble runtime overhead, making it suitable for practical deployment.Advantages:• A better method than Execute-no-Read in preventing just-in-time code reuse attacks• Provides strong security protection against such attacks•",No-Execute-After-Read: Preventing Code Disclosure in Commodity Software,https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/papers/near.asiaccs16.pdf,Jan Werner,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585053_jan-werner,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,US Patent Pending US 2017/0213039,#16-0058

Pediatric and Adult Peripheral Cannulation Simulator,"A pediatric and adult Peripheral Cannulation Simulator has been developed for heart catheterization, medical device placement and mechanical circulatory support. This device incorporates visual feedback and a working pump with fluid-filled, pulsatile venous and arterial vasculature (aka PCS), and uses a human neck, torso, and upper thigh form, combined with pressurized tubing and a pump with variable, controlled pressure and flow direction to allow for the insertion of medical devices, catheters, sheaths, and cannulae of all kinds designed for mechanical circulatory support using Seldinger technique. During and after insertion, the devices may be viewed via a translucent “atrium” within the chest of the simulator in order to facilitate teaching and learning of proper device insertion and positioning, as well as to visualize flow dynamics (if colored fluid or otherwise labeled fluid was used) and the entrainment of air during the use of mechanical circulatory support devices. Because the tubing used to simulate the vasculature is distensible and embedded in silicone molds, it can be visualized with ultrasound during insertion of medical devices. The nature of the connections of the tubing in this device allow for the simulator to be connected to a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit or other mechanical circulatory support pump system and to indefinitely circulate fluid within the vasculature, to the mechanical support system pump, and return to the vasculature via cannula, thus simulating the proper use of the medical device as it might be used in a living person. PCS can be used for training of field/military ECMO, cathlab, ER docs, and nurses.Advantages:• The carotid artery is connected to the femoral artery and both are pulsatile• Can be connected to mechanical support and used to achieve continuous, indefinite circulation on the support device• Allows for a functional interaction with other devices in a much more high-fidelity, working capacity•",Nouvant,https://www.nouvant.com,Jennifer Nelson,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18585045_jennifer-nelson,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,PCT Patent Application WO 2017/127724,#16-0080

BCL6 and SIRT1 as Biomarkers of Endometriosis and Endometrial Dysfunction,"BCL6 and SIRT1 are predictors of endometriosis and endometrial dysfunction, and consequently can be used as diagnostic tools for endometriosis. Both BCL6 and SIRT1 were found to be elevated in the eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis. Furthermore, studies in a baboon animal model of induced endometriosis showed that levels of SIRT1 and BCL6 increased with time after induction. Once diagnosis of endometriosis is made, there are effective treatments, many of which involve surgery. However, due to the widely varying symptoms of endometriosis and lack of concrete diagnostic tools, many physicians are reluctant to perform these treatments. Consequently, there is often a slow time to diagnosis for patients, and a large number of unnecessary invasive surgeries conducted on patients who have pelvic pain without having endometriosis. This technology may be developed into a sensitive diagnostic test for endometriosis that will help physicians determine the best course of treatments for patients in a timely fashion, and eliminate potentially unnecessary invasive surgeries.

Two Dimensional Electrides as Battery Electrode Materials,"A new class of two-dimensional materials has been developed for battery electrodes that are derived from bulk electride crystals such as Ca2N, Sr2N, Ba2N, and Y2C. Electrides are materials that trap electrons at stoichiometric concentration, such that the electrons themselves serve as counteranions. Despite rapid progress in the last decade to synthesize, isolate, and use electrides, a number of challenges hinder their potential application. For example, the low surface area and limited electron accessibility of bulk electride surfaces inhibit their potential utility as novel catalysts and conductive materials. These materials are synthesized by a liquid exfoliation process in which large pieces of layered electrides are placed in a solvent and subjected to sonication. The resulting nanosheets have a two-dimensional morphology and can be further isolated and separated by centrifugation or solvent removal.

Poly-Metformin: A Polymeric Formulation for the Treatment of Metabolic Disorders and Enhanced Gene Delivery,"A polymeric formulation of Metformin has been developed. PolyMetformin (PolyMet) has been successfully synthesized through conjugation of linear polyethylenimine (PEI) with dicyandiamide. The delocalization of cationic charges in the biguanide groups of PolyMet reduces the toxicity of PEI both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the polycationic properties of PolyMet permit capture of siRNA into a core-membrane structured Lipid-Polycation-Hyaluronic acid (LPH) nanoparticle for systemic gene delivery. Even in the absence of RNAi, LPH-PolyMet nanoparticles act similarly to Metformin and activate the AMPK pathway. AMPK activation causes the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, triglyceride synthesis, lipogenesis, and can stimulate hepatic fatty acid oxidation. LPH-PolyMet nanoparticles show promise as a therapy for metabolic disorders such as diabetes, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Advantages:• PolyMet can circulate for a longer time in the body compared to Metformin• Dual purpose therapeutic agent• Reduced cytotoxicity from conventional nanoparticle formulations",PolyMetformin combines carrier and anticancer activities for in vivo siRNA delivery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4897747/,Leaf Huang,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584978_leaf-huang,Leodis Gupton Commercialization Manager 919.966.4132,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/369_leodis-gupton,Provisional Patent Application Filed ,#15-0060

Delivery of Neuroprotective Therapeutic Agents to the CNS,"Innovative polymer-based formulations have been developed for delivery of neurotrophins to the brain using peripheral and central administration. The anionic block copolymers are used in charge excess with respect to the neurotrophins, so that neurotrophins and block copolymers form a nanoscale size polyion complex, while the free block copolymers are also present in the formulation. The formulation increases serum and mucosal stability and prevents enzymatic degradation of neurotrophins. The excess of the block copolymer inhibits efflux of neurotrophin from the brain, thereby increasing the brain levels of neurotrophin. These novel compositions are used to treat.Advantages:• Rapid and non-invasive delivery of proteins to the brain• Targeted delivery within brain compartments• Platform technology allows development of formulations based on various therapeutical proteins• Reduction of peripheral exposure to therapeutical proteins• Significant reduction of rare and costly proteins needed to achieve therapeutically meaningful doses in specific brain regions",Nanoformulation of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor with Target Receptor-Triggered-Release in the Central Nervous System,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/adfm.201703982,Alexander Kabanov,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584963_alexander-kabanov,Leodis Gupton Commercialization Manager 919.966.4132,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/369_leodis-gupton,PCT Patent Application PCT/US2017/015930,#15-0104

Automatic Obstacle Avoidance During Tentacle-like Robot Teleoperation,"A motion planning approach for concentric tube robot teleoperation that enables a tentacle-like robot to interactively maneuver its tip to points selected by a user while automatically avoiding sensitive anatomical obstacles (e.g., critical vessels, nerves, and organs) along its shaft. The user specifies goal positions by clicking with a 3D mouse on an augmented reality interface, and the robot automatically moves its tip to the specified goal position while avoiding contact with obstacles. This approach could enable surgeons to perform safer and less invasive surgeries with fewer medical errors by decreasing cognitive load on surgeons during procedures and providing a level of automatic control of the device.

Use of Non-cylindrical Bead Well Geometries to Improve Assay Readout in a Compact Microwell Array,"Novel, non-cylindrical bead well geometries have been
developed that improve detection in bead-based assays. Well geometries are
fabricated such that one area of the well is optimized for magnetic loading and
bead retention, and another region of the well is used for signal detection.
The two regions of the well are fluidically connected to each other allowing
for reagents or analytes to diffuse or mix. By spatially separating the bead
from the detection region, the contribution of bead background fluorescence to
the signal can be reduced or eliminated, thus improving the signal to noise
ratio. Related technologies have been developed that increase multiplexing
capability by incorporating dye stability as a measurement (16-0015) and
utilize bead-based delivery of reagents to facilitate parallel assays on a
multiplexed-in-space microfluidic device (12-0128).

Use of Ice-Nucleating Proteins to Improve Performance of Freeze-Thaw Valves in Microfluidic Systems,"This methodology utilizes ice-nucleating proteins (INPs) as additives to initiate the freezing of water or aqueous solutions at higher temperatures and improve the performance of freeze-thaw-valves in microfluidic chips. Ice-nucleating proteins are produced by fungi, bacteria, and other organisms, and are capable of inducing ice crystal formation in microfluidic systems at temperatures as warm as -2 °C. In microfluidic systems that utilize multiple liquids or reagents, valves are often necessary to modulate fluid flow. Various valving technologies have been employed, but most require complicated or relatively expensive microstructures and/or external hardware. Freezing can be used to modulate fluid flow on microfluidic devices through freeze-thaw valves (FTVs). FTVs utilize an external cooling source to freeze a plug of fluid in a channel, thus stopping fluid flow in the desired regions of the chip. The channel can then be opened by warming the plug until it thaws. A high degree of supercooling, often to temperatures below -20 °C, is typically needed to freeze water in most microfluidic devices. The ice-nucleating protein, inaZ, from Pseudomonas syringae has been utilized to create a FTV with an internal temperature of -11 °C.Advantages:• Compatible with both elastic/flexible materials and inelastic/inflexible materials• INPs significantly reduce the average time water must be held below the freezing point before crystallization occurs• Allows precise fluid control with computer-controlled/automated capabilities• Uses simple and easy to manufacture chip architectures with no moving parts•",Use of Ice-Nucleating Proteins To Improve the Performance of Freeze–Thaw Valves in Microfluidic Devices,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00556,J Ramsey,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584947_j-ramsey,John Rainwater Commercialization Manager 919.445.9371,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/365_john-rainwater,Provisional Patent Application Filed ,#15-0136

These unique signals are due to over-expansion and oscillating frequencies induced upon oscillation of PCCAs. Once activated by a primary source, the vaporization event can be monitored passively by ultrasound. PCCAs have been gaining increasing attention in recent years as agents for diagnostic and therapeutic applications of ultrasound, and this detection method has the potential to benefit ultrasound technology and result in new therapeutic and diagnostic imaging techniques.Advantages:• This technology allows for the detection of unique acoustic signatures created by PCCAs• Detection of these signals can be differentiated from those of standard microbubble contrast agents• Detection of these signals allows spatial localization and quantification of PCCA activation, and may be useful for diagnostic and therapeutic applications of ultrasound•",Nouvant,https://www.nouvant.com,Paul Dayton,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584945_paul-dayton,Charlie Shaw Commercialization Manager 919.966.3929,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/373_charlie-shaw,US Patent Pending US 2016/0262727,#14-0009

Vibration-Induced Stem Cell Chondrogenesis and Osteogenesis,"A surgically implantable bioreactor that induces either
chondrogenesis (cartilage development) or osteogenesis (formation of bone) from
mesenchymal stem cells has been developed.
In vitro studies in which vibratory signals were provided to both human
and porcine mesenchymal stem cells demonstrated that at lower frequencies the cells
differentiate into a cartilage phenotype, and will conversely differentiate
into a bone phenotype at higher frequencies.
Delivery of these vibratory signals in vivo would provide a novel
treatment option for bone and cartilage replacement. Currently, replacing bone or cartilage in
patients is accomplished with grafts to the site or with chemical induction of
chondrogenesis or osteogenesis.
Unfortunately, the success of these procedures is often unpredictable due
to problems with host rejection or insufficient induction of the correct tissue
type. This technology avoids these
problems because the bioreactor is able to drive tissue lineage selection of
mesenchymal stem cells simply through vibrational stimulation. Using the same technology, these researchers
have invented an in vitro device that is able to stimulate stem cells in
culture with vibrational frequencies between 1 and 100 hertz to better study
the mechanical induction of a cartilage or a bone cell lineage. These devices
represent a novel means to direct the development of mesenchymal stem cells and
provide better options for bone and cartilage replacement. Additionally, this system can help study stem
cell lineage determination induced by vibrational forces in the in vitro cell
culture system.
Advantages:
•
Eliminates the need for grafting and may
diminish chance of host tissue rejection 
•
No pharmacological agents involved 
•
Ability to adjust device program to better
direct tissue-specific growth

Minimal-latency Tracking and Display for Matching Real and Virtual Worlds in Head-worn Displays,"Methods, systems, and computer readable media have been developed for minimal-latency tracking and display for matching real and virtual worlds in head-worn displays (i.e., opitical see-through glasses). The system includes a display module, a rendering module, and a processing module. This also offers a new method of reducing latency that takes advantage of the principles of bufferless input/output and “minimal-latency” processing throughout all main components of an AR system, i.e., tracking, rendering, and display. The method calculates a user- perceived image, calculates a desired image, calculates an error image, identifies an error portion, and updates a portion of a projected image. The systems and/or methods have the potential to minimize lag-induced registration errors, which are the main effect of high latency in current systems. This technology can be implemented in software in combination with hardware and/or firmware. In addition to education benefits, societal benefits include more hand-eye coordination and augmented imagery anywhere the user looks. The approach can also benefit research, as it is useful for spatial AR and handheld AR devices that rely on low-latency visual feedback in response to moving objects and gestures.Advantages:•",From Motion to Photons in 80 Microseconds: Towards Minimal Latency for Virtual and Augmented Reality Sign In or Purchase,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7383304/?arnumber=7383304,Henry Fuchs,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584909_henry-fuchs,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,US Patent Pending US 2017/0345398,#14-0139

The innovation lies not in the design of the photodetector (sensor), but in the data encoding and the communication and processing architecture. Tradeoffs between frame rates, electronic shutter speeds, dark current and bright saturation are optimized for various target applications, with enhancements such as Regions Of Interest (ROI) for higher frame rates, and composition of multiple frames with varying exposure times for improved dynamic range. The methods improve the process of data acquisition from a spatially distributed array of analog continuous time sensors. In general, these methods can be applied to any collection of spatially distinct positive-definite continuous-time continuous-level signal sources, the desired outputs of which are to be discretely digitized representations of their respective time integrals.Advantages:•",Nouvant,https://www.nouvant.com,Montek Singh,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584907_montek-singh,Peter Liao Commercialization Manager 919.843.5028,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/358_peter-liao,US Patent Pending US 2017/0126991,#14-0143

A Synthetic Route to Pactamycin Amenable to Analog Preparation,"A key intermediate has been developed in a short, asymmetric total synthesis of pactamycin that is amenable to analog preparation. Pactamycin is a natural product that demonstrates potent anti-tumor, anti-microbial, and anti-viral activities, but its development as a drug candidate is hindered by its high cytotoxicity. Recent pactamycin analogues derived from genetic engineering techniques show reduced toxicities, but genetic engineering approaches to generate pactamycin analogues are limited in flexibility and diversity. Conversely, an efficient chemical approach offers the potential for greater scope in the creation of pactamycin analogues. The cyclopentenone core intermediate is prepared from intramolecular aldol condensation of the claimed aldehyde precursor. This intermediate has been used to synthesize pactamycin.Advantages:• Modular total synthesis is 15 steps from commercially available starting materials•","Enantioselective synthesis of pactamycin, a complex antitumor antibiotic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=((chapel%20hill%5BAffiliation%5D)%20AND%20pactamycin)%20AND%20%22science%22%5BJournal%5D,Jeffrey Johnson,http://technologies.unc.edu/inventors/18584899_jeffrey-johnson,John Rainwater Commercialization Manager 919.445.9371,http://technologies.unc.edu/managers/365_john-rainwater,Pactamycin,#13-0041
